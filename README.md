# T9BeamTestAna
Analysis package for the T9 beam test


To compile the code type make in the main directory.

## Processing data

The first analysis stage includes processing data files. The output is a root file with anaTree TTRee. It includes, trigger timestamps, pedestals, pedestals standard deviations, signal amplitudes and times.

USAGE: **./bin/waveform_analysis.app** -i input_list_file -o output_root_file -c analysis_config.json

  **-i input_list_file**      --> ASCII file with run file names (one file per line). It allows users to run with multiple runs. If you put # before  the file name, it will be "commented out" (not used by the code)
  
  **-o output_root_file**     --> output root file
  
  **-c analysis_config.json** --> json configuration file (an example is located in config/config.json

## Making plots
Navigate to scripts/ directory. 

root -q -b '**MakeDataPlots.C**("output_file_from_step1", momentum)'

The script will use int momentum to recognize which cuts it needs to use. The script output is a root file with the same name as the input and "_plots" appended to the end. It contains:
  - reference histograms (they have "ref" in the name and don't change when you apply cuts) 
  - TOF histograms that are used to estimate the fraction of particles.  

## Fitting: the TOF distribution:
Done by **scripts/FitTOF.C**, a compilable ROOT macro
 - By default, a 3-component fit of 3 Gaussians is fitted to extract the number of e, mu and pi events;
 - In the macro, booleans isThreeComponentFit and isProtonFit are set automatically based on the momentum.

Example running:
 ** root -l "scripts/FitTOF.C(\"output_260n_plots.root\",-260)"


## Additional scripting over all momenta

The list of runs for every momentum is stored in **python/data_runs.py**
 - edit as needed, must enter also the total number of spills for the runs

The runs are split to low (200--280 MeV), high (300--360 MeV) and p (>= 400 MeV) runs.

Create a link name 'data' to a folded holding the TB ROOT files in name format as root_run_000153_0000_clean.root
  -  ln -s YOURPATHTODATA data

Running the waveform analysis, plotting and fitting for all momenta: done by **./python/run_momenta.py**

One has to specify whether really run (0/1), or just print the commands to choose from, or optionally not run but just fit by '0f'. Momentum range low/high/p must be specified, so e.g.:

 - python ./python/run_momenta.py 1 low     # run, make histos, fit the TOF; for low momenta
 - python ./python/run_momenta.py 0f high   # do not run, just fit, higher momenta
 - python ./python/run_momenta.py 0 p       # just print commands for the proton runs

Output are png's, pdf's; and mainly ascii files with fitted numbers of e, mu, pi; or p; or mu+pi over 300 MeV.
 - E.g. ascii_output_220p_plots.txt

## plotting the mu and pi yields scaled to per day rates

 - ...based on interval between spills of 40s; as function of the momentum:
 - This is done by **python/plotFromAscii.py** for which one needs to choose the negative or positive beam p/n and the momenta range (low, high, or 'p' for protons).

 - python ./python/plotFromAscii.py p low
 
 - python ./python/plotFromAscii.py n low
 
 - python ./python/plotFromAscii.py p high
 
 - python ./python/plotFromAscii.py n high
 
 - python ./python/plotFromAscii.py p p # for protons

One can make a html page for viewing the fit results:
  -  ./scripts/make_html.sh
